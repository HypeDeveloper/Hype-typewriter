# Hype Typewriter ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž

Hype Typewriter is a JavaScript class that provides a typewriter effect. It simulates the typing and deleting of text, creating a typewriter-like animation. This can be useful for adding an engaging and interactive element to your web pages.

## Usage

To use the Typist class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the Typist class, passing the desired options as an argument.

   ```javascript
   const typist = new Typist(options);
   
   
 The options parameter is an object that can contain the following properties:

1. **targetId (string)**: The ID of the HTML element where the typewriter effect will be applied.
2. **typeSpeed (number):** The speed at which characters are typed in milliseconds.
3. **delSpeed (number):** The speed at which characters are deleted in milliseconds.
4. **cursorClass (string):** A CSS class to style the cursor element.
5. **loop (boolean):** Whether to restart the typewriter effect after completion.
6. **cursorString (string):** The string representing the cursor.
7. **onEnd (function):** A callback function to be called when the typewriter effect completes.

Call the start() method to start the typewriter effect.

   ```javascript
   typist.start();
   ```


The options parameter is an object that can contain the following properties:

1. **targetId (string):** The ID of the HTML element where the typewriter effect will be applied.
2. **typeSpeed (number):** The speed at which characters are typed in milliseconds.
3. **delSpeed (number):** The speed at which characters are deleted in milliseconds.
4. **cursorClass (string):** A CSS class to style the cursor element.
5. **loop (boolean):** Whether to restart the typewriter effect after completion.
6. **cursorString (string):** The string representing the cursor.
7. **onEnd (function):** A callback function to be called when the typewriter effect completes.

Call the start() method to start the typewriter effect.

```javascript
typist.start();
This will begin the typewriter animation on the specified target element.
```

**(Optional)** Control the visibility of the cursor using the hideCursor() and showCursor() methods.

```javascript
typist.hideCursor(); // Hide the cursor
typist.showCursor(); // Show the cursor
These methods allow you to hide or show the blinking cursor element associated with the typewriter effect.
```

Ensure that you have an HTML element with the specified targetId where the typewriter effect will be applied.

```html
<div id="typist-container"></div>
```
Make sure to replace "typist-container" with the actual ID of your target element.


### Examples

Here's an example of using the Typist class with some sample options:

```javascript
const typist = new Typist({
  targetId: 'typist-container',
  typeSpeed: 150,
  delSpeed: 800,
  cursorClass: 'custom-cursor',
  loop: true,
  cursorString: '|',
  onEnd: () => {
    console.log('Typewriter effect completed');
  },
});

typist.start();

```

In this example, the typewriter effect will be applied to an element with the ID "typist-container". The characters will be typed at a speed of 150 milliseconds, deleted at a speed of 800 milliseconds, and a custom CSS class named "custom-cursor" will be applied to the cursor element. The effect will loop indefinitely, and the cursor will be displayed as a vertical bar (|). Finally, the onEnd callback function will be executed when the typewriter effect completes.



### Note

to add a plain text use
```javascript
type1.text = 'Hello i can do this'
```
For a coustom text trick here are some very important tricks
1. to perform a backspace action add a '~' then give a space a then a 'de[number of chars to remove]
      ```javascript
      type1.text = 'Hello i can do this ~ de[4] everything with code'
      ```
      
2. to add a custom style to a word or letter add a '~' then give a space then add a span tag with a classname of the style u wish to use
      ```javascript
      type1.text = 'Hello i can do this ~ de[4] everything with ~ <span class="codeColor"> code </span>'
      ```
      Use '' not "" to avoid errors
